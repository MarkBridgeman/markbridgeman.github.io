Blogging hasn't been something I've found easy for almost 20 years. 

In the before-social-media times - even in the before-MySpace-times - way back in the 90s, I was an "online journal writer", and I would post personal updates to a journal, which went through various name changes and designs as I taught myself web design and online publishing. 

This was before blogging or CMS systems, before Greymatter and Blogger and whatever other things popped up.

Now, this is a self-rolled Jekyll-based static blog using Netlify as a platform. No, I don't know what half of that means either.
