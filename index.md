Hi, I'm Mark.
{:.lead}

This blog is an exercise in learning new tech, writing about life, and other misc.

`Losfer` is taken from the Iron Maiden instrumental "Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)" off their most-excellent 1984 LP *Powerslave*.

I'm using the Chirpy Jekyll theme here, with some functionality taken from [Dan Tsekhanskiy's blog](https://tseknet.com/blog/) - apologies for the blatant theft.
