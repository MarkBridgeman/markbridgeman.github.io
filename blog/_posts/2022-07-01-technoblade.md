[Technoblade: Minecraft YouTuber dies from cancer aged 23](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62006852)

The news came this morning; I had barely any recognition of the name Technoblade other than knowing he was a YouTuber who played games. So this isn't anything about the man himself, or his legacy, but it brought up thoughts on the wider impact positive influences - not influenc*ers* - like Technoblade have on fans, colleagues, and the community.

Reading the quotes from other YouTubers reflecting on his passing reminds me of when CynicalBrit - another gaming YouTuber with a wide fanbase, who also died from cancer - passed away. I DID know who he was, and had followed his early-ish career when he covered World of Warcraft; I wasn't always a fan of his output, but I certainly admired his personal integrity towards the gaming industry.

So I can understand the impact this is having on the Minecraft community in losing one of their good ones.

Technoblade was only 23. Very sad, and I feel for his family and fans who have lost someone who obviously was a great guy.

Life is far too short.
