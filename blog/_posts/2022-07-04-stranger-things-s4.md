Season 4 of Netflix's flagship horror-teen-romp Stranger Things, split into Volume 1 & Volume 2, is now complete.

Possibly Netflix's only juggernaut in their stable, compared to all their other output, it's a testament to the show's appeal that multiple years between seasons can continue to draw people in.

S4 proved to be a worthwhile return, being stronger than the already-strong S3 (which didn't have much competition from the quite weak S2), and with the introduction of not only 2 new enjoyable characters (not including Big Bad, Vecna himself), and a split 4-way storyline.

Let's look at the new characters first.

## Eddie Munson

Eddie proved to, pretty much immediately, be a huge fan favourite. After an initial dorky introduction which paid homage to every 80s rebel-outcast-teen film, the character soon settled down into being a rather nice chap. 

He was used to being spurned by society, loves heavy metal and Dungeons & Dragons, and deals drugs: all winning characteristics I'm sure you'll agree.

The friendship he forms with Dustin rivals that of Steve + Dustin (albeit a different dynamic), and he soon slots into the Hawkins-based storyline quite nicely.

## Argyle

At first seemingly shallow character to begin with - typical stoner-surfer--california-bro - he soon morphs into a solid sidekick for the Cali crew, without losing his Scooby-Doo charm.
