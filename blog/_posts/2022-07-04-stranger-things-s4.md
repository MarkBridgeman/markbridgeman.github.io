Season 4 of Netflix's flagship horror-teen-romp Stranger Things, split into Volume 1 & Volume 2, is now complete.

Possibly Netflix's only juggernaut in their stable, compared to all their other output, it's a testament to the show's appeal that multiple years between seasons can continue to draw people in.

S4 proved to be a worthwhile return, being stronger than the already-strong S3 (which didn't have much competition from the quite weak S2), and with the introduction of not only 2 new enjoyable characters (not including Big Bad, Vecna himself), and a split 4-way storyline.

Let's look at the new characters first.

## Eddie Munson

Eddie proved to be a huge fan favourite, pretty much immediately. After an initial dorky introduction which paid homage to every 80s rebel-outcast-teen film, the character soon settled down into being a rather nice chap. 

He was used to being spurned by society, loves heavy metal and Dungeons & Dragons, and deals drugs: all winning characteristics I'm sure you'll agree.

The friendship he forms with Dustin rivals that of Steve + Dustin (albeit a different dynamic), and he soon slots into the Hawkins-based storyline quite nicely.

## Argyle

At first seemingly shallow character to begin with - typical stoner-surfer--california-bro - he soon morphs into a solid sidekick for the Cali crew, without losing his Scooby-Doo charm. 

While the show treats him as a dorky sidekick to Jonathan for much of the show, he does come through in the end, in a tilt which benefits everyone (not trying to spoil too much, but obviously by now... too late).

I dug this character big time, not least because he's a staunch supporter of pineapple on pizza. I hope, come S5, he makes a return.


## The Season Itself

Spreading the show across two volumes wasn't something initially planned, as far as I understand it, but instead a necessity due to time constraints in finishing things in time for the launch of the first batch of episodes. 

This duely created an immense amount of speculation of how the final two chapters would unfold, not least the fate of everyone's new fave metalhead Eddie.

Overall, the ending proved worthy - albeit with one unwelcome death and one unwelcome near-miss - and I'm hyped for Season 5 which should be here in... about 2 years, if we're lucky.
