[Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_(TV_series)) is a comedy-drama that's been [produced since 2018](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5348176/), with the premise of a hitman who - somehow (watch the show) - falls into an acting class in Hollywood, and finds a release from the grind of, you know, shooting people for a living.

Three seasons down, and the show is a fantastic mix of drama, comedy, and just the downright absurd. 

From Barry's interactions with his acting class, his 'manage' (ie, the bloke who arranges his hits), and a member of the Chechen mafia who is possibly the most *delightful* and always-positive character I've seen in a drama.

I'm not going to go into details of each season, other than to say it's a must-watch if mafria murders, high intrigue, and amateur acting classes are your thing. 

The latest season came out this year, and we've just finished watching it (after a slight detour due to needing to watch and re-watch [S4 of Stranger Things](/blog/stranger-things-s4)), and I'm happy to say HBO has ordered a 4th season, which considering the ending of S3 - and no spoilers - is a Very Good Thing.
